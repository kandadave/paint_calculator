# The Paint Calculator

A practical web application for generating paint quotations, built with HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript, featuring a live backend.

By David Chumo

## Description

This application helps users easily calculate estimated costs for painting projects. It's designed to demonstrate key front-end development concepts, including form handling, dynamic calculations, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous data fetching. The application interacts with a live backend API  which uses **JSON Server** to manage the storage and retrieval of quotation history, providing a persistent and robust experience for users.

## Features

  * **User Details Input**: Collects essential client information like full name, email, and phone number.
  * **Painting Project Details**: Gathers critical project specifications including the area to be painted (in square meters), number of paint coats, paint type (interior/exterior), and specific paint category.
  * **Dynamic Cost Calculation**: Calculates estimated paint material cost, labor cost, transport cost, and miscellaneous/overhead expenses based on configurable rates fetched from a mock API.
  * **Detailed Quotation Output**: Displays a clear breakdown of all estimated costs and a grand total for the current quotation.
  * **Quotation History**: Stores and displays a list of all previously generated quotations, allowing users to review past estimates.
  * **Edit and Delete Quotations**: Users can easily edit existing quotations by pre-filling the form with saved data or delete quotations from the history.
  * **Responsive Design**: A clean, modern, and interactive user interface that adapts well to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile) thanks to the utility-first approach of **Tailwind CSS**.
  * **Client-Side Logic**: All calculations and DOM updates happen seamlessly on the client-side, providing a smooth user experience without full page reloads.

## How to Use

### Requirements

  * A computer with **Node.js** installed (for `npm` commands).
  * Access to the internet.
  * A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
  * A code editor (VS Code recommended).
  * Terminal/Command Line.

### View Live Site

Visit the deployed application at: [The Paint Calculator](https://kandadave.github.io/paint_calculator/)

The live site allows you to:

  * Generate new paint quotations.
  * View details of any past quotation.
  * Edit and delete existing quotations.

### Local Development

If you want to run the project locally, follow these steps:

#### Installation Process

1.  **Clone this repository** using:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kandadave/paint_calculator 
    ```

    or by downloading a ZIP file of the code.

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```bash
    cd paint_calculator 
    ```

3.  **Install JSON Server**: This will act as your mock backend API.

    ```bash
    npm install -g json-server@0.17.4
    ```

4.  **Install Live Server**: This will serve your frontend files.

    ```bash
    npm install -g live-server
    ```

5.  **Start the Backend (JSON Server)**: Open your terminal in the project directory and run:

    ```bash
    json-server db.json
    ```

    This will start the mock API, usually accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. Keep this terminal window open.

6.  **Start the Frontend (Live Server)**: Open a **new** terminal window in the project directory and run:

    ```bash
    live-server
    ```

    Your default web browser should automatically open the `index.html` file, typically at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` or `http://localhost:8080`.
    Alternatively, if you use VS Code, you can install the "Live Server" extension and click "Go Live" from the bottom bar while `index.html` is open.

## Technologies Used

  * **HTML5**: For structuring the web content.
  * **CSS3**: For styling and creating the appealing, responsive layout, primarily using **Tailwind CSS**.
  * **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For all interactive functionalities, DOM manipulation, form handling, and asynchronous operations (using `Fetch API` with Promises) to interact with the mock backend.
  * **JSON Server**: The application uses a JSON Server to provide lightweight REST API for supplying the rates and managing quotation data. This server is hosted on Render.com, offering persistence for out `db.json` file.
